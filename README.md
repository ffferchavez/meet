## Serverless Functions in Meet

Meet uses serverless functions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of its backend processes. Serverless functions are employed to:
- **Fetch and Cache Event Data:** Functions periodically fetch the latest event data from external APIs, cache the results, and serve them to users, ensuring the app remains responsive and up-to-date even when offline.
- **Process User Interactions:** When users filter events by city or change the number of displayed events, serverless functions dynamically fetch and process the relevant data, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Generate Event Charts:** Serverless functions aggregate and process event data to generate visualizations, such as charts displaying the distribution of upcoming events, without overloading the client-side application.

This approach ensures that the application remains responsive, scalable, and cost-effective by leveraging cloud-based serverless technologies.
